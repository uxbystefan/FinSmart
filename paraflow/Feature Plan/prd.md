# PRD â€” AI-Powered Financial Guidance Mobile App

## 1) Background

Many everyday consumers struggle with financial decision-making due to information overload, lack of personalized guidance, and complexity of financial products. This creates a significant gap where people either make suboptimal financial choices or avoid taking action altogether, leading to missed wealth-building opportunities. This iteration addresses the core Charter principles of making financial wisdom accessible through intelligent, personalized recommendations. It directly serves both our Ambitious Saver persona who wants optimized financial strategies and our Cautious Beginner persona who needs confidence-building guidance. Now is the right time to build this solution as AI technology has matured enough to provide personalized financial insights while mobile-first approaches have become essential for reaching our target demographics.

## 2) Objectives & Desired Outcomes

- Users gain confidence in their financial decisions through personalized AI recommendations that explain the reasoning behind each suggestion, reducing financial anxiety and decision paralysis.
- People develop consistent wealth-building habits by receiving actionable, bite-sized financial guidance that fits their specific income, expenses, and goals rather than generic advice.
- Users experience measurable improvement in their financial health through optimized saving strategies, appropriate investment selections, and goal-oriented planning that adapts to their changing circumstances.
- Non-goals / Boundaries: We will not execute trades, manage portfolios directly, provide tax advice, or handle complex estate planning - focusing instead on education, guidance, and decision support.
