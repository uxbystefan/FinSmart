## About Carlos

Carlos is a dedicated teacher and father of two who has always been conservative with money, keeping most savings in traditional bank accounts. He's reached a point where he realizes inflation is eating away at his purchasing power, but he's hesitant to take financial risks. He wants to learn about better options but needs reassurance and education before making any changes to his financial approach.

## Behavioral Considerations

- Prefers gradual changes and wants to start with small, low-risk steps before committing to bigger financial decisions
- Highly values security and stability, often choosing familiar options even if they're not optimal
- Learns best through clear explanations and real-world examples rather than complex financial jargon
- Tends to research extensively and seek multiple opinions before making financial moves

## Frustrations

- Feels left behind by friends who seem more financially savvy and worry he's not doing enough for his family's future
- Traditional savings accounts offer almost no return, but investment options feel risky and complicated
- Limited time to research financial topics between work and family responsibilities

## Goals

- Protect his family's financial security while finding ways to grow their savings more effectively than traditional bank accounts
- Understand basic investment concepts without feeling overwhelmed or pressured into high-risk strategies
- Create a simple financial plan that doesn't require constant monitoring or complex decision-making

## Tasks

- Evaluate safer investment options that offer better returns than savings accounts while minimizing risk
- Set up automatic savings and investment contributions that work within his budget
- Learn fundamental financial concepts at his own pace through educational content
- Monitor progress toward family financial goals like college savings and retirement planning
- Find ways to optimize spending on family expenses while maintaining their quality of life
