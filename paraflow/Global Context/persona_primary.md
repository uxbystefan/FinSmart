## About Maya

Maya is a career-focused millennial who earns a decent salary but feels overwhelmed by financial planning. She's moved beyond living paycheck-to-paycheck but struggles to know how to optimize her money for long-term goals. She spends time researching financial topics online but finds conflicting advice frustrating and wants personalized guidance that fits her specific situation and goals.

## Behavioral Considerations

- Uses mobile apps for most daily tasks and expects financial tools to be as intuitive as social media platforms
- Prefers bite-sized information she can consume during commutes or lunch breaks rather than lengthy financial articles
- Values transparency and wants to understand the "why" behind financial recommendations before taking action
- Actively seeks ways to automate good financial habits but wants to maintain control over major decisions

## Frustrations

- Generic financial advice doesn't account for her specific income, expenses, and goals
- Investment platforms feel intimidating with too many options and complex terminology that makes her second-guess decisions
- Difficulty determining if she's on track financially or if her savings rate is appropriate for someone her age and income level

## Goals

- Build an emergency fund and start investing for retirement while still enjoying her current lifestyle
- Understand which financial products and strategies are right for her without spending hours researching
- Develop confidence in making financial decisions and track progress toward her long-term wealth-building goals

## Tasks

- Check spending patterns and identify areas where she can save money without major lifestyle changes
- Set up and monitor savings goals for various objectives like emergency fund, vacation, and down payment
- Research and select appropriate investment options based on her risk tolerance and timeline
- Track progress toward financial milestones and adjust strategies based on changing circumstances
- Learn about financial concepts relevant to her current life stage and income level
