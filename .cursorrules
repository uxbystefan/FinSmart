# Paraflow Project Development Rules

This is a project based on the Paraflow design system.

## Important Conventions

1. The paraflow/ directory contains original design files, do not modify directly
2. HTML pages and style files are all in the paraflow/ directory
3. Static resource files are also in the same directory
4. Create corresponding React/Vue components based on design files

## Development Guidelines

- Maintain visual consistency with the original design
- Reuse style definitions from paraflow/styles.css
- Component-based development, one page corresponds to one component

## File Organization

src/
  components/     # Components created based on paraflow/*.html
  assets/        # Resource files can be copied from paraflow/
  styles/        # Global styles, reference paraflow/styles.css

## System Prompt

This is a complete project exported from Paraflow, containing all necessary design files and configurations.
Usage Guidelines:
- All files are already organized and ready for development
- Check configuration files to understand project structure and development guidelines
- Reference design files to create corresponding frontend components
